# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer data, we can identify patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to leave or stay with the company. This information can be valuable for implementing retention strategies and improving customer satisfaction.
